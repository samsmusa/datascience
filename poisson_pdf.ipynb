    "The poisson distribution deals with the frequency with which an event occurs within a specific interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "instead of the probability of an event, the poisson distribution requires knowing how often it occurs.\n",
    "for a specific period of time or distance.\n",

    "A firefly might light up three times in 10 seconds on average, we should use a poisson distribution if we want to determine the likelihood of it lighting up eight(8th) times in 20 seconds."
